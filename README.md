# Text Function

In Microsoft Excel, the **TEXT function** is a function that allows you to format a numeric value as text based on a specified format code. You can use this function to display texts, numbers, dates, and times in a way that makes them more readable, user-friendly or adheres to a specific format. This function is valuable for creating custom-formatted labels, data exports, reports, and more. For this part, LEN function, UPPER function, LOWER function, Proper Function, and LEFT function will be shown.

<br>
**LEN Function**
<br>
The **LEN function** is used to count the number of characters in a given text string, including letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. The basic syntax for this function  is
$$
=LEN(text)
$$
For example, if cell A1 contains the text "Iron Man", then you can use =LEN(A1). The result will be 8 as there are 8 characters in the text including letters, comma, and spaces.

Overall, the TEXT function is a versatile tool in Excel that plays a significant role in data formatting and presentation, making data more understandable and visually appealing. It's widely used in financial, accounting, and data analysis tasks, among others.
